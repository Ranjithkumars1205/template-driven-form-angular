this project made only for template-driven form.

1. import formsModule in appmodule
2. ng g c user-settings-form
3. bootstrap site -> documentation -> components - forms - just look at only
4. npm i --save bootstrap -> after done check it in package.json
5. angular.json -> styles array -> put minfied version of bootstrap - "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
6. check it whether working or not by putting btn btn-primary


we may need to populate that form initially with some object. this object is called a model or a data model.
